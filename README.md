# java-xml-workhop

Several small programs showcasing libraries and algorithms. 

Some of them have been found and recovered from old hard disks, and slightly refactored to do not make the eyes bleed.

* xml-dtd-validator validates a XML given a DTD with standard classes. Pre 2013
* xml-console-utils to easily test xml-utils module
* xml-tools-gui a GUI program with some simple XML utilities, from some pre-2011 concept proofs putted together in this app
	- XML to tree view
	- Simple XPath valuation
	- XML pretty print using SAX parser
* xml-utils to provide basic general XML utilities as XPath validation, namespaces... Aand slowly replace the old xml-tools-gui
